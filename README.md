### Native use
Traders work without Tecknobit's Android interface

#### Interface

You have to create your code flow to use trader

//Platform means Binance or Coinbase actually
PlatformTraderBot trader = new PlatformTraderBot(/*your keys and constructor params*/);
//Operation example
trader.buyMarket("BTCBUSD", 1);
```
#### Autonomous

Traders automatically make trading flow, like checking, buying and updating your wallet

```java
//Platform means Binance or Coinbase actually
PlatformAutoTraderBot trader = new PlatformAutoTraderBot(/*your keys and constructor params*/);
//Start autonomous trader flow 
trader.start();
```

### Android use
Traders work with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tecknobit.traderbot">Tecknobit's Android interface </a><br>
All data will be stored and restored automatically, **will be not saved** your exchange platform api keys. <br>
**Note:** is recommended to use different password from exchange's account for Tecknobit's account for a major security.
#### Auth operations
- #### Registration
    To register a new trader, both traders type, you have to use Credentials object to init your Tecknobit's account credentials.
    In first attempt will throw a SaveData exception, so you can save credentials generated.

```java
//In registration you have to init Credentials object with your email and password for Tecknobit's account.

Credentials credentials = new Credentials(
    "yourEmail@email.com",
    "yourPassword"
);

//Program will automatically stop and will give to you auth credentials in this format:

/*{
        "secret_key": "valueOfSecretKey",
        "password": "yourPasswordInserted",
        "email": "yourEmailInserted@email.com",
        "iv_spec": "valueOfIvSpec",
        "auth_token": "valueOfAuthToken",
        "token": "valueOfToken"
}*/

//Note you must save these credentials where you retain safe because them are needed in auth operations.
```

- #### Login

    "valueOfAuthToken",
    "yourEmail@email.com",
    "yourPassword",
    "valueOfIvSpec",
    "valueOfSecretKey"
);

AndroidPlatformTraderBot trader = new AndroidPlatformTraderBot(/*your keys and constructor params*/, credentials);
